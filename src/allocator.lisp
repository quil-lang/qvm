;;; This file manages the allocation of CFLONUM vectors in different
;;; spaces.
;;;
;;; There are two components to this file: allocation descriptions,
;;; and the allocation method.
;;;
;;; Allocation descriptions describe how much memory to allocate and
;;; where. It's all specialized on CFLONUM-VECTORs right now, since
;;; that's mostly all the QVM uses. These are implemented as classes,
;;; that at least have some sort of ALLOCATION-LENGTH method to
;;; indicate how many CFLONUMs should be allocated.
;;;
;;; The allocation method is ALLOCATE-VECTOR. This method is
;;; specialized on the aforementioned types. Critically, this method
;;; provides both the allocated data, as well as some finalizing
;;; function to free the memory. Since data might be allocated
;;; somewhere else besides the managed Lisp heap, it's up to you, the
;;; programmer, to call the freeing function. (Save us the trouble and
;;; don't cheat! Even with LISP-ALLOCATION vectors! If you decide to
;;; change your mind later you'll regret it! If you don't want to use
;;; the allocation interface, use MAKE-LISP-CFLONUM-VECTOR.)
;;;
;;; Note that not all ALLOCATE-VECTOR specializations live in
;;; this file.
