;;; Implementation of rule-based noise models for the QVM. These rules
;;; are meant to express locations in a qvm program to inject noise in
;;; the form of kraus operators.  A NOISE-MODEL is made up of a list
;;; of NOISE-RULES, where each NOISE-RULE is a NOISE-PREDICATE and a
;;; list of OPERATION-ELEMENTS. The NOISE-PREDICATE defines how to
;;; match QUIL instructions around which to apply the kraus operators
;;; defined by the OPERATION-ELEMENTS. 
;;;
;;; Example: A common noise model is the depolarization channel. To
;;; model depolarization on a qubit, inject depolarization operators
;;; after every gate on that qubit. We can build this noise model
;;; using NOISE-RULES in the following way.
;;;
;;; (let ((noise-predicate  (make-noise-predicate (match-strict-qubits 0) 19 :after))
;;;       (operation-elements (depolarizing-kraus-map .15)
;;;       (noise-rule (make-noise-rule noise-predicate operation-elements)
;;;       (noise-model (make-noise-model (list noise-rule))
;;;       (program "X 0; Y 1; H 0")
;;;
;;; The application of the above NOISE-MODEL to a CHANNEL-QVM running
;;; the program defined above would be to apply the OPERATION-ELEMENTS
;;; after the first and third instructions. The first argument in
;;; MAKE-NOISE-PREDICATE is a predicate function that returns true
;;; when an instruction it receives operates on exactly qubit 0. The
;;; next argument, 19, is a NOISE-PRIORITY, which indicates that this
;;; noise predicate should be attempted to be matched before other
;;; lower priority rules. The third argument :after, is the
;;; NOISE-POSITION, which tells the qvm to apply the
;;; OPERATION-ELEMENTS for this rule after the INSTR.  We can also
;;; define readout noise by setting the READOUT-POVMS for qubits in
;;; the QVM using the QUBIT-POVM setf function.

;;; These values are relatively arbitrary limits for NOISE-PREDICATE
;;; priorty. They are used to order noise models for matching to
;;; instructions.

;;; the predicate should match before or after an instruction. The
;;; optional NAME parameter is used to name the NOISE-RULE that
;;; contains a NOISE-PREDICATE.
