;;; This file implements density matrix evolution.


;;; General Overview

;;; The general approach taken here is that the DENSITY-QVM inherits
;;; most of its behavior from the PURE-STATE-QVM, but provides more
;;; specific methods for a few operations (namely TRANSITION, MEASURE,
;;; and MEASURE-ALL). A density matrix ρ of n qubits is represented in
;;; a PURE-STATE-QVM as a 2n qubit vector of amplitudes, vec(ρ). On
;;; the other hand, the DENSITY-QVM also maintains a 2^n x 2^n array
;;; displaced to vec(ρ), for convenience. See below for the definition
;;; of vec(ρ).

;;; Another feature of our implementation is that support for noisy
;;; operations and measurements mirrors the interface presented by
;;; NOISY-QVM. In particular, the DENSITY-QVM presents
;;; NOISY-GATE-DEFINITIONS and READOUT-POVMS slots, and has a similar
;;; interface for updating these slots (through the SET-NOISY-GATE and
;;; SET-READOUT-POVM methods, respectively).

;;; Superoperators

;;; Ordinary gates, as well as user-specified "Kraus operators", are
;;; represented by a SUPEROPERATOR type. The quil syntax for
;;; specifying Kraus operators is the same here as in the NOISY-QVM --
;;; namely, through pragmas a user may specify a "noisy gate" on a
;;; specific set of qubits, and during DENSITY-QVM evaluation such a
;;; noisy gate definition will replace the usual unitary one. The
;;; primary difference between the DENSITY-QVM and the NOISY-QVM in
;;; this regard is that application of a noisy gate in the DENSITY-QVM
;;; is completely deterministic and "folds all of the noisy" into the
;;; density matrix, whereas the NOISY-QVM is nondeterministic and
;;; tracks only a specific realization of the gate noise.

;;; Measurement

;;; In the PURE-STATE-QVM there is only one sensible meaning for a
;;; measurement: outcomes are sampled according to their respective
;;; probabilities, and then wavefunction collapse occurs. In the
;;; DENSITY-QVM, this could in principle be augmented by a second
;;; notion of measurement: namely, the outcome probabilities allow us
;;; to compute an "expected" outcome, which is generically a mixed
;;; state. The situation here is analogous to the question of gate
;;; noise, where one must choose between working with a specific
;;; realization of the noise process or its entire
;;; distribution. Whereas for noise we prefer the latter, for
;;; measurement we prefer the former, because i) it is necessary to
;;; force collapse when measurements are needed for classical control,
;;; and ii) it is what most people expect anyways.
