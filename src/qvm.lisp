;;; This file implements a PURE-STATE-QVM.

;;; General Overview

;;; The BASE-QVM is base class that implements the fundamental
;;; functionality that every QVM will use. The BASE-QVM can evolve
;;; both pure state wavefunctions and density matrices by means of its
;;; STATE slot, which can be either a PURE-STATE or DENSITY-MATRIX
;;; STATE or any state matching the protocols defined in MEASURE,
;;; APPLY-GATE, and STATE-REPRESENTATION. Furthermore, the BASE-QVM
;;; supports the application of superoperators, which can be applied
;;; to both types of state representation when added to QUIL programs
;;; via the ADD-KRAUS PRAGMA.

;;; PURE-STATE, in which the wavefunction of the quantum system is
;;; represented by a 2^(n qubit) vector of amplitudes. The
;;; PURE-STATE-QVM also supports superoperator applications by
;;; stochastically applying the kraus operators they are represented
;;; by to the STATE.
