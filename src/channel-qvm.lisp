;;; General Overview:

;;; This file implements a CHANNEL-QVM which can interpret a rule-based
;;; NOISE-MODEL and apply kraus operators to its state. This
;;; NOISE-MODEL is a collection of NOISE-RULES that trigger
;;; applications of channels based on the syntactic properties of
;;; instructions in a CHANNEL-QVM program. Each NOISE-RULE contains a
;;; NOISE-PREDICATE and a list of OPERATION-ELEMENTS. The
;;; NOISE-PREDICATE describes how to match qvm instructions, and which
;;; instructions to match. The OPERATION-ELEMENTS are the physical
;;; description of the channel, represented as a list of kraus
;;; maps. At each qvm instruction, the OPERATION-ELEMENTS of a
;;; NOISE-RULE whose NOISE-PREDICATE matches that instruction is
;;; applied to the state of a the CHANNEL-QVM. Only one rule can be
;;; matched by an instruction. If multiple NOISE-RULES match the
;;; current instruction, the rule with the highest PRIORITY is
;;; applied.

;;; The CHANNEL-QVM supports both PURE-STATEs and
;;; DENSITY-MATRIX-STATEs. For a PURE-STATE STATE, the CHANNEL-QVM
;;; stochastically applies kraus operators by selecting one at
;;; random. Instead, if the CHANNEL-QVM uses a DENSITY-MATRIX-STATE,
;;; the kraus operators are converted to superoperators before they
;;; are applied to the density matrix.

;;; The CHANNEL-QVM requires an explicitly defined NOISE-MODEL. At the
;;; TRANSITION to each new instruction, the CHANNEL-QVM checks to see
;;; if any NOISE-RULES are matched by the instruction, and if so, the
;;; CHANNEL-QVM applies the corresponding noise defined by the
;;; NOISE-RULE.
